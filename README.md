# Best practices in data visualization - ASPP 2022

## Content

* **[Best practice in data visualization](slides.pdf)** [here with notes](slides_notes.pdf) (**PDF**). Slides accompanying the tutorial, together with some written notes.

* **[Exercise 1: Mastering matplotlib](exercise-1.ipynb)** (**notebook**). In this
    introduction, we'll see how to make a figure and play with the
    different settings such as to improve the rendering. We learn how to use style sheets, and how to fine tune your plot. 
    We also learn how to make a figure composed by several subplots.

* **[Exercise 2: Which visualization should I use?](exercise-2.ipynb)** (**notebook**). In this exercise you are given a dataset and you're asked to think, decide and implement a data visualization that will best answer a research question. 

* **[Exercise 3: Working with imags](exercise-3.ipynb)** (**notebook**). Here you will learn how to visualize data as images.



## Extra-Material (from ASPP-2021)

* **[Scales & projections](https://github.com/ASPP/2021-bordeaux-dataviz/blob/master/03-scale-projection.ipynb)**
  (**notebook**). Tutorial on different scales scales (log scale, symlog scale, logit scale) and projections
  (polar, 3D, geographic).

* **[Animation](https://github.com/ASPP/2021-bordeaux-dataviz/blob/master/04-animation.ipynb)** (**notebook**). Animation with
  matplotlib can be created very easily using the animation framework. This notebook shows how to create an animation and save it as a movie.
