# Best practices in data visualization - ASPP 2022, Bilbao<a href="https://aspp.school/wiki/">

<br/><br/>


## Content

* **[Best practice in data visualization](slides.pdf)** (**PDF**). Slides accompanning the tutorial.


* **[Exercise 1: Mastering matplotlib](exercise-1.ipynb)** (**notebook**). In this
    introduction, we'll see how to make a figure and play with the
    different settings such as to improve the rendering. We learn how to use style sheets, and how to fine tune your plot. 
    We also learn how to make a figure composed by several subplots.

* **[Exercise 2: Which visualization should I use?](exercise-2.ipynb)** (**notebook**).  
In this exercise you are given a dataset and you're asked to think, decide and implement a data visualization that will best answer a research question. 

* **[Exercise 3: Working with imags](exercise-3.ipynb)** (**notebook**).  
Here you will learn how to visualize data as images.



## Extra-Material

* **[Scales & projections](03-scale-projection.ipynb)**
  (**notebook**). Matplotlib offers the possibility to use different
  scales (log scale, symlog scale, logit scale) and projections
  (polar, 3D, geographic). We'll review a few of them in this lesson.

* **[Animation](04-animation.ipynb)** (**notebook**). Animation with
  matplotlib can be created very easily using the animation
  framework. During this lesson, we'll show how to create an animation
  and save it as a movie.
